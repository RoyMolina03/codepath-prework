    An App Idea I've floated around before is an all in one employee scheduling / messaging app for a workplace. Employees would have the ability to view their schedules, call out, and request shift exchange requests all within the app and message the manager through the app so that all communication is recorded. Managers would be able to send out mass alerts for call outs to find covers / give more hours to those who are looking for some. Employees would be able to ask their peers to swap shifts with one another and managers could see and approve of all requests. Team messages could be had with multiple chats or one singular feed, user preference prioritized.
    

## Notes

The instructions were simple and straight forward - I enjoyed getting to use xCode for the first time and it really solidified the idea of developing apps on it for me. I liked the live simulator that honestly ran so well it felt unreal.
